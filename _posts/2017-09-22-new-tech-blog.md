Hi and welcome to my new tech blog. I have for many years thought about starting a blog, but have always been struggling against thoughts like where and how to publish it. But now I'm starting one!

I often have a lot of thoughts and ideas about software development, and regularly stumble across interesting matters in the field. Usually I keep the discoveries for myself or discuss it with people around me. Now I will try to share some of them here. I also hope that I will write some tutorials in areas where I canâ€™t find a comprehensive one on the Internet. The articles will probably vary in both field, depth and size. Hopefully it will benefit others, but also benefit myself while going through the writing process. 

Stay tuned!
